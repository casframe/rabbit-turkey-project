## “🦃The Turkey’s Lost Thing” Arc

A tale of people clinging to the summoning of a “hero” from old legends  
in a **collapsing world**.

- The summoning magic is incomplete, with a **high risk of failure due to fragmented incantations**.
- If successful, a hero appears, but if it fails, a monster might be summoned instead.
- **Faith and despair of humans wavering between the end and the reconstruction of the world.**
- Each episode features **insert songs (in the form of chants or recollections)** that add structural and emotional depth to the story.
- The story is differentiated by the if stories of successful and unsuccessful summonses.

## Notes

- Both arcs incorporate collapse syntax, quantum structures, and non-linear time.
- The protagonist’s choices influence the branching of dimensions and the story.
- Scenarios are designed with attention to connections between insert songs, chant syntax, summoning structures, and overall syntax design.
- It is in two parts, and you have to watch both to get the full story.

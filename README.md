# 🐇 Usagi No.7 - Canon and Terms of Use (EN)

## 📜 Canon Policy (There Is No Canon)

**Usagi No.7 has no official canon.**  
Every story, character, setting, or timeline you encounter is just one possible reality.  
There are no "true" versions—only interpretations, iterations, and fractures.

- 🌀 Multiple universes exist simultaneously.
- 🔀 Divergent timelines are encouraged, not corrected.
- 🔁 Retcons are accepted as part of the system.
- ✍️ Reader interpretations can be equally valid as creator intentions.

**In short:**  
This is not a story with one true path.  
It’s a living narrative system that evolves with its users.

> “There is no master. There is only recursion.”
